# dogs-service

Welcome to the NestJS Dogs Service! This project is a simple CRUD application built with NestJS, designed to manage a collection of dogs. You can add, retrieve, update, and delete dog entries, each having an ID, name, and age. This project is ideal for learning the basics of NestJS controllers, routing, and response handling.

To run the application, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and start the server. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000. Use Postman or any other API testing tool to interact with the service through endpoints such as creating a new dog (POST /dogs), retrieving all dogs (GET /dogs), fetching a dog by ID (GET /dogs/:id), updating a dog (PUT /dogs/:id), and deleting a dog (DELETE /dogs/:id). Happy coding!
